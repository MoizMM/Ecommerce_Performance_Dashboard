Processed raw e-commerce data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized formats to prepare the dataset for analysis.
Data Aggregation and Measures:

Created custom measures such as Conversion Rate, Users Placed Order, and Gross Merchandise Value to meet client-specific requirements.
Applied advanced DAX formulas for dynamic and insightful calculations.
Data Modeling:

Established relationships between tables to enable seamless interaction across data dimensions.
Optimized the data model to enhance performance and query efficiency.
Visualization:

Designed an interactive dashboard with clear and concise visuals to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions.
Used bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts to highlight trends and comparisons effectively.
